# Staking Messaging Guidelines

## ✅ CORRECT Messaging

### Primary Message
```
"Stake AION to earn a share of protocol revenue"
```

### APY Explanation
```
"Stakers receive a share of protocol revenue.
Estimated APY depends on volume & fees."
```

### Risk Disclosure
```
"Returns are variable and depend on platform activity.
Estimated APY is not guaranteed and may increase or decrease.
Smart contract risk exists."
```

### How It Works
```
• Stake AION to receive shares of the staking pool
• Earn 2% of all battle fees proportional to your stake
• Returns vary based on platform activity and total staked
• Minimum stake: 100 AION | Lock period: 7 days
```

### Revenue Distribution
```
Battle Volume → 2% Platform Fee → Distributed to Stakers

Example:
- Daily battles: 5,000 AION
- Platform fee (2%): 100 AION
- Your stake: 10% of pool
- Your daily share: 10 AION
- Estimated APY: ~365% (variable)
```

## ❌ INCORRECT Messaging

### Never Say:
- ❌ "Guaranteed 15% APY"
- ❌ "Fixed returns of 40%"
- ❌ "Risk-free staking"
- ❌ "Zero risk"
- ❌ "Guaranteed profits"
- ❌ "Earn up to 40% APY" (implies promise)

### Never Imply:
- ❌ Fixed or predictable returns
- ❌ No risk involved
- ❌ Investment advice
- ❌ Security-like guarantees

## UI Text Examples

### Hero Section
```
✅ "Stake AION to earn protocol revenue"
❌ "Earn 40% APY by staking"
```

### Stats Display
```
✅ "Estimated APY: ~365% (variable)"
❌ "Current APY: 365%"

✅ "24h Revenue: 100 AION"
❌ "Daily Guaranteed: 100 AION"
```

### Stake Button
```
✅ "Stake to Earn Revenue Share"
❌ "Stake for 40% Returns"
```

### Info Banner
```
✅ "Returns depend on platform activity and are not guaranteed"
❌ "High returns with low risk"
```

## Legal Disclaimers

### Required on Every Page
```
⚠️ Risk Disclosure:
Staking returns are variable and not guaranteed. Actual returns depend on:
- Platform trading volume
- Total amount staked by all users
- Market conditions
- Smart contract functionality

Past performance does not indicate future results.
This is not financial advice.
```

### Footer Text
```
AION-X is a decentralized prediction market protocol.
Staking rewards come from protocol fees, not token emissions.
Returns are variable and not guaranteed.
Use at your own risk.
```

## Marketing Copy

### Website
```
✅ "Earn a share of every trade"
✅ "Real yield from protocol fees"
✅ "Revenue sharing for stakers"
✅ "Variable returns based on activity"

❌ "Guaranteed high returns"
❌ "Fixed APY staking"
❌ "Risk-free passive income"
```

### Social Media
```
✅ "Stake AION → Earn protocol fees → Variable APY"
✅ "More battles = More revenue for stakers"
✅ "Real yield, no token inflation"

❌ "40% APY guaranteed!"
❌ "Risk-free staking live!"
❌ "Earn passive income with zero risk"
```

### Documentation
```
✅ "Staking allows users to earn a proportional share of protocol revenue"
✅ "Returns fluctuate based on platform usage"
✅ "APY is estimated and may vary significantly"

❌ "Stakers earn fixed returns"
❌ "Guaranteed yield for all participants"
```

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Returns | "40% APY guaranteed" | "Estimated APY: ~365% (variable)" |
| Risk | "Zero risk" | "Low risk, not guaranteed" |
| Source | "High yield staking" | "Protocol revenue sharing" |
| Promise | "Earn up to 40%" | "Earn based on activity" |
| Stability | "Fixed returns" | "Variable returns" |

## Regulatory Compliance

### Why This Matters
- Fixed APY = Investment contract = Security
- Variable revenue share = Utility = Not security
- Honest disclosure = Legal protection
- Misleading claims = Regulatory action

### Safe Harbor Language
```
"AION staking is a revenue-sharing mechanism where participants 
receive a proportional distribution of protocol fees. Returns are 
variable, not guaranteed, and depend on platform usage. This is 
not an investment contract and does not constitute financial advice."
```
